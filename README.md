### About the Experiment 

This experiment provides an interactive simulation environment to understand the MOESI (Modified, Owned, Exclusive, Shared, Invalid) cache coherence protocol used in multiprocessor systems. Students will explore how the five-state protocol maintains data consistency across multiple processor caches while optimizing memory bandwidth through cache-to-cache transfers and intelligent state management.

The simulation allows learners to execute read and write operations across multiple processors, observe state transitions, analyze bus traffic patterns, and understand the advantages of MOESI over simpler coherence protocols like MSI and MESI.
